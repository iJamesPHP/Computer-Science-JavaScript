          <h1>JavaScript Traffic Lights <small>My documentation for question 3 of the controlled assesemnt</small></h1>
      </div>
      <h3>(i) <small>- Make a list of required assets.</small></h3>
      <p>
        For this question I was asked to crete an animated set of "<i>Traffic Lights</i>" using JavaScript.
        <br>
        From the get-go I knew how to do this. I would need some simple coloured circle images then I could easily change these images on the page.
        <br>
        I would need:
        <ul>
          <li>A red circle image.</li>
          <li>An amber circle image.</li>
          <li>A green circle image.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I started by booting up PhotoShop and producing some basic assets.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/JavaScript/3/asset-red-circle-photoshop.png" alt="Setting up ul" class="img-rounded" height="25%" width="25%" />
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/JavaScript/3/asset-amber-circle-photoshop.png" alt="Setting up ul" class="img-rounded" height="25%" width="25%" />
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/JavaScript/3/asset-green-circle-photoshop.png" alt="Setting up ul" class="img-rounded" height="25%" width="25%" />
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>(ii) <small>- Describe where the assets would be best located.</small></h3>
        <br>
        With all web-based programming, it's important to stay organised. I like to keep images and other assets sorted in a neat directory structure.
        <br>
        For these images, I've saved them in:
        <br>
        <br>
        <kbd>Site > images > projects > traffic_lights > red-circle.png</kbd>
        <br>
        <kbd>Site > images > projects > traffic_lights > amber-circle.png</kbd>
        <br>
        <kbd>Site > images > projects > traffic_lights > greem-circle.png</kbd>
        <br>
        <br>
        This sort of file structuring is very useful. It allows you to manage your assets with ease and also helps the client's browser slightly with caching.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>(iii) <small>- Describe the structure of an array that could be used to handle the traffic light sequence.</small></h3>
        <br>
        Here's my array to control the lighting sequence.
        <br>
<pre>var lightSequence = [
  {red: true, amber: false, green: false},
  {red: true, amber: true, green: false},
  {red: false, amber: false, green: true},
  {red: false, amber: true, green: false}
];</pre>
      <br>
      I decided to use an array of objects. Each object contains light states for each light.
      <br>
      So, for example, this array means it will be <b>RED / OFF / OFF</b> first, then it will be <b>RED / AMBER / OFF</b>, then it will be <b>OFF / OFF / GREEN</b> <br>
      then it goes to <b>OFF / AMBER / OFF</b> so that the sequence can go on.
      <br>
      When the user presses a button to start the sequence, I will progress through the array and reflect the states onto the lights with delays inbetween.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>(iv) <small>- Write a script to produce an animation of a set of traffic lights such that the lights change in the standard sequence each time the button is clicked.</small></h3>
      <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/iJamesPHP/39feb0a251627d6a77b23dfb98b671ef.js"></script>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>4. <small>- Change the animation script so that the sequence of lights is displayed automatically on a timed basis without user input.</small></h3>
      <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/iJamesPHP/65e1dfd9cc0823fbea29c6efaa1fcaa2.js"></script>
      <br><br>
      <h3>5. <small>- Scripts can be embedded in the HTML of web pages or saved externally as script files. Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.</small></h3>
      <br>
      With large-scale web applications, there's often a vast amount of JavaScript, these scripts are often saved in <code>.js</code> file elsewehere on the host
      and are then reffered to from the html using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
      <br><br>
      Like this:
      <br><br>
      <code>&lt;script src="path/to/script.js" /&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, your scripts can be included inline within your HTML document like so:
      <br />
      <br>
      <code>&lt;script&gt; alert("hi"); &lt;/script&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Pros & Cons of external JavaScript</h4>
      <hr>
      <h5>Pros</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy organisation</li>
        <li>Easier to write longer scripts</li>
        <li>CDN (Content Delivery Network) capability, get files to people in different countries quicker</li>
        <li>Reference pre-written scripts and frameworks</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h5>Cons</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>If a script on a slow server is referenced, page loading times will suffer</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Pros & Cons of inline JavaScript</h4>
      <hr>
      <h5>Pros</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier to understand</li>
        <li>Faster loading times for smaller scripts</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h5>Cons</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Hard to write longer scripts</li>
        <li>If working on a big project, you can't organise your scripts very well</li>
        <li>Your script always has to be served by the same host as your entire page, this means people in different countries to the host will have slow loading times</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      Even for small projects, I think external JavaScript is a better option, any cons are easily avoidable and it has great pros.
      <br><br>
      As long as your script is on a fast server then there won't be any noticeable loading time sacrifices, this will let you organise better and furthermore write longer scripts
      with piece of mind.
