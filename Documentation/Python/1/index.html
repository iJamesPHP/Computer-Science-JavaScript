      <h4><i>Analysis</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        So, I need to develop a program where in which the user can find answers to common problems they might be having with their
        mobile device.
        <br>
        I need to make this program short and sweet, my target consumers aren't looking for a beautified program, they just want to fix
        their phone. This also saves me time and effort.
        <br>
        The first question I need to ask myself is what components of my programming knowledge am I going to have to use to develop this
        program. I wrote a short list in my notebook in real life, here's what i wrote:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            IF / ELSE / ELIF Statements
            <ul>
              I need these statements to decypher what the user inputs and work out which solution I need to give the user
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions
            <ul>
              I'm going to use functions to tidy up my code and make sure I'm not repeating things too much, a quick use I
              can think of is to write a function that displays a given message and then exits, this is for giving the
              solutions.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        For this I'm choosing to cover all the requirements by using a basic IF/ELIF/ELSE structured text-based program. This is because
        a program like this is easy to create so therefore I can focus on functionality and features rather than a needlessly pretty graphical
        based program.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><b><i>Success Criteria</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll list what I want to achieve with my program so that I can compare my end result to it in my evaluation.
        <hr>
        This is my <b>success criteria</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Have atleast 10 possible outcomes of the troubleshooting tree</li>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then just tell them to take it to the nearest repair shop</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Planning</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        For my planning I've made a flowchart and also written some basic outline pseudocode to help display and demonstrate how my program will
        function and what basic logic it will follow.
        <br><br>
        Here's my <b>flowchart</b>:
        <br><br>
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/Python/1/flowchart.png" class="img-rounded" height="35%" width="35%" />
        <br><br>
        And here's my <b>pseudocode</b>:
        <br>
        <pre>
          phone_very_wet = input("Has your phone gotten very wet? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
          if phone_very_wet == 'y' then
              print('Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop!')
          elif phone_very_wet == 'n' then
              phone_wet = input("Has your phone gotten wet at all? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
              if phone_wet == 'y' then
                  print('Please try leaving your phone in a bowl of dry rice overnight!')
              elif phone_wet == 'n' then
                  pass
              else then
                  exit()
          else then
              exit()

          phone_slow = input("Is your phone running very slowly? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
          if phone_slow == 'y' then
              phone_old = input('Is your phone model more than 3 years old? (y/n)') -> to lowercase
              if phone_old == 'y' then
                  print("Upgrade your phone to a newer model!")
              elif phone_old == 'n' then
                  print("Conduct a hard reset on your phone!")
              else then
                  exit()
          elif phone_slow == 'n' then

          elif phone_smashed == 'n' then

          else then
              exit()

              print('Please clean out the charging port on your phone by blowing hard into it!')
          elif phone_wont_charge == 'n' then
              pass
          else then
              exit()

          phone_lost = input("Is your phone lost? (y/n)") -> to lowercase

              print('Please contact your phone provider!')
          elif phone_lost == 'n' then
              pass

              exit()

          phone_battery_issues = input("Is your phone turning off at random battery percentages? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
          if phone_battery_issues == 'y' then
              iosten = input("Is your phone running iOS 10 or above? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
              if iosten == 'y' then
                  updated = input("Is your phone updated to the most recent version? (y/n)") -> to lowercase
                  if updated == 'y' then
                      print('Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop!')
                  elif updated == 'n' then

      <h4><i>Development</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Here's my <b>commented end code</b>:
        <br>
        https://gist.github.com/iJamesPHP/7772bc475fa93b5e1a3111f759997e9b
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5><b><i>Discussion</i></b></h5>
      <p>
        In this section I'll describe the different aspects of my program, how they work and why I've chosen to do it that way.
        <hr />
        Rather than diving straight into the core logic, I start by defining functions that I'll find useful later in my program. I start by
        defining a function called <code>sysp()</code>, I use this function instead of the <code>print()</code> function so that I can always
        add the same prefix to all my outputs and structure them nicely.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>sysinp()</code>, this function is to add the same prefix as <code>sysp()</code> to input messages.
        <br>
        <br>
        I found that in all of my IF statements, I'd end up needing to tell the user that their input was wrong and exit the program if they
        typed in something that isn't allowed. I wrote another function called <code>incorrect_answer()</code> that tells the user their input is wrong
        and exits the program after. This saved me alot of time and lines of code, this will also help me change the incorrect answer reaction across the
        whole program by only re-writing one section of code if needs be.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>solution()</code> that prints out a given solution and exits the program.
        <br>
        <br>
        I start by asking for the user's name, then greeting them with their inputted name to add a welcoming element to the program.
        <br>
        <br><br>
        <h5><b><i>Core Logic</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll delve deeper into my core logic and how my code works proceduraly.
        <hr>
        Now I get into the core logic of the program, esentially it's just a series of IF/ELIF/ELSE statements, I start with the first statement by asking the user
        if their phone has gotten very wet.
        <br>
        Then I follow this logic:
        <ol>
          <li>If the user typed 'y':</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>solution()</code> -> Tell the user to take their phone to the nearest repair shop</li>
            <li>Exit</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Else if the user typed 'n':</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask the user if their phone has gotten slightly wet</li>
            <ol>
              <li>If the user typed 'y':</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>solution()</code> -> Tell the user to try leaving their phone in a bowl of dry rice overnight</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else if the user typed 'n':</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Move on to the next statement</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>incorrect_answer()</code></li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <li>Else:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>incorrect_answer()</code></li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        Next I move onto the next statement by asking the user if their phone is running very slowly.
        <br>
        Then I follow this logic:
        <ol>
          <li>If the user typed 'y':</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask the user if their phone model is older than 3 years old</li>
            <ol>
              <li>If the user typed 'y':</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>solution()</code> -> Tell the user to upgrade their phone to a newer one</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else if the user typed 'n':</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>solution()</code> -> Tell the user to take their phone to the nearest repair shop</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>incorrect_answer()</code></li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <li>Else if the user typed 'n':</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask the user if their phone has gotten slightly wet</li>
            <ol>
              <li>If the user typed 'y':</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>solution()</code> -> Tell the user to try leaving their phone in a bowl of dry rice overnight</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else if the user typed 'n':</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Move on to the next statement</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Else:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>incorrect_answer()</code></li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <li>Else:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>incorrect_answer()</code></li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The rest of the program runs as described using the same logic and I cover the following problems:
        <ul>
          <li>Has your phone screen smashed?</li>
          <li>Is your phone failing to charge?</li>
          <li>Is your phone lost?</li>
          <li>Is your phone turning off at random battery percentages?</li>
        </ul>


      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Testing</i></b></h5>
      <hr>
      To test different elements of my program, I'm using something called a <b>test plan</b>.
      <br>
      I'll use the <b>test plan</b> to test different scenarios and then compare the expected outcomes to the actual outcomes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here's my <b>test plan</b>:
      <br>
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Scenario</th>
            <th>Data Used</th>
            <th>Expected Outcome</th>
            <th>Actual Outcome</th>
            <th>Evaluation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>An answer to a question that isn't allowed</td>
            <td>Typing 'test' instead of 'y'/'n' when asked if my phone screen is smashed</td>
            <td>To be told it's an incorrect answer and then the program will exit</td>
            <td>I was told it's an incorrect answer and the program exited</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Solution for a user with a phone less than 3 years old that's running very slowly</td>
            <td>Answering 'y' to if the user's phone is running very slowly and 'n' to if the user's phone is older than 3 years</td>
            <td>To be told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>I was told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Inputting a blank name</td>
            <td>Setting my name as ''</td>
            <td>To be told it's an incorrect name and to exit</td>
            <td>Program outputted 'Hello, '</td>
            <td>This feature wasn't working, I forgot to add an IF statement checking wether or not the user inputted a blank name</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      From my test plan I only notice one thing that isn't behaving as expected (the blank name input) and it was fixed by adding a forgotten
      IF statement.
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Evaluation</i></b></h5>
        <hr>
        I feel as if I have achieved everything I set out to do from my analysis.
        <br><br>
        Now I'll use my success criteria to make sure that I have:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Have atleast 10 possible outcomes of the troubleshooting tree</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, I have atleast 10 possible outcomes</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, all potential illegal inputs are accounted for and dealt with approprietly within my program</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then just tell them to take it to the nearest repair shop</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, no matter what order of answers is given by the user, a solution is always offered</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Great, I have completed my success criteria. My program also meets all requirements stated explicitly and implicitly within
          the task
