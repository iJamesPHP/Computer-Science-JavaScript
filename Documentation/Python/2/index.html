      <h4><i>Analysis</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        So, I need to develop a program where in which the user can find an answer to an issue to do with their phone that they can
        type as they please.
        <br>
        This program needs to incorporate a mechanism that cross references words within the users issues with predefined keywords
        and outputs a relavent solution.
        <br>
        The first question I need to ask myself is what components of my programming knowledge am I going to have to use to develop this
        program. I wrote a short list in my notebook in real life, here's what i wrote:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            IF / ELSE / ELIF Statements
            <ul>
              I need these statements to work out whether or not the user's issue contains any of the pre-defined keywords or not
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions
            <ul>
              I'm going to use functions to tidy up my code and make sure I'm not repeating things too much, a quick use I
              can think of is to write a function that displays a given message and then exits, this is for giving the
              solutions.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            WHILE Loops
            <ul>
              I'm going to use WHILE loops to loop over the core logic a certain amount of times so that I can give the user a number of 'attempts'
              they can have until the program ends
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            FOR Loops
            <ul>
              I'm going to use FOR loops to loop over the words within the user's written issue and cross reference them against my pre-defined keywords
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dictionaries
            <ul>
              I'm going to use dictionaries to store the keywords along with their related solution
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrays
            <ul>
              I'm going to use arrays to record keyword matches found within the user's issue
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><b><i>Success Criteria</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll list what I want to achieve with my program so that I can compare my end result to it in my evaluation.
        <hr>
        This is my <b>success criteria</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Succesfully loop over every individual word within the user's issue</li>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then just tell them to take it to the nearest repair shop</li>
          <li>Offer tailored solutions based on keywords within the user's issue</li>
          <li>Give the user a limited number of attempts until giving them a vague repair shop solution</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Planning</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        For my planning I've made a flowchart and also written some basic outline pseudocode to help display and demonstrate how my program will
        function and what basic logic it will follow.
        <br><br>
        Here's my <b>flowchart</b>:
        <br><br>
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/Python/2/flowchart.png" class="img-rounded" height="50%" width="50%" />
        <br><br>
        And here's my <b>pseudocode</b>:
        <br>
        <pre>
          keywords = {
              'smashed'      : 'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop',
              'charging'     : 'Try cleaning out your charging port on your phone by blowing into it',
              'screen'       : 'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop',
              'wet'          : 'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop',
              'water'        : 'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop',
              'slow'         : 'You may need to upgrade your phone',
              'audio'        : 'Try hard resetting your phone',
              'sound'        : 'Try hard resetting your phone',
              'home'         : 'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'
          }

          loops = 0
          while loops <= 1 do
              issue = input('What is your issue?') -> to lowercase
              if issue -> stripped == '' then
                  print('incorrect answer')
                  exit()
              else then
                  words = issue -> split
                  matches = []
                  for word in words do
                      if word in keywords then
                          matches -> append(word)
                      else then
                          continue
                  if len(matches) > 0 then
                      print('Solution: '+keywords[matches[0]])
                      exit()
                  else Then
                      if loops == 0 then
                          print('Sorry, we do not have a solution for the given issue, please try again.')
                      else then
                          break
                      loops += 1

          print('Sorry, we could not find a solution for you.')
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Development</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Here's my <b>commented end code</b>:
        <br>
        https://gist.github.com/iJamesPHP/d918783d24acb912feb2fc70cdec68bf
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5><b><i>Discussion</i></b></h5>
      <p>
        In this section I'll describe the different aspects of my program, how they work and why I've chosen to do it that way.
        <hr />
        Rather than diving straight into the core logic, I start by defining functions that I'll find useful later in my program. I start by
        defining a function called <code>sysp()</code>, I use this function instead of the <code>print()</code> function so that I can always
        add the same prefix to all my outputs and structure them nicely.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>sysinp()</code>, this function is to add the same prefix as <code>sysp()</code> to input messages.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>solution()</code> that prints out a given solution and exits the program.
        <br>
        <br>
        I start by asking for the user's name, then greeting them with their inputted name to add a welcoming element to the program.
        <br>
        <br><br>
        <h5><b><i>Core Logic</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll delve deeper into my core logic and how my code works proceduraly.
        <hr>
        Now I get into the core logic of the program, esentially it's just a while loop that will loop a maximum of 2 times that takes the user's
        inputted issues, spits the words into an array, loops over the words checking for keywords, stores matched keywords in an array, checks if the array
        has been populated, if it has: print related solution & exit else: ask the user to try again. If no solution is found after 2 attempts, exit.
        <br>
        <br>
        I chose to use these logical steps in my program because it let's me cover the most important requirement, keyword matching. By looping over each
        individual word in the user's issue, I can give the user a related solution while still letting the user type their own issue in their own words.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have solutions for these keywords:
        <ol>
          <li><kbd>smashed</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>charging</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Try cleaning out your charging port on your phone by blowing into it'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>screen</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>wet</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>water</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>slow</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'You may need to upgrade your phone'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>audio</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Try hard resetting your phone'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>sound</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Try hard resetting your phone'</i>
          </ul>
          <li><kbd>home</kbd></li>
          <ul>
            <i>'Please take your phone to the nearest repair shop'</i>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Keywords should be chosen in such a way that most possibe user issues are covered.
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Testing</i></b></h5>
      <hr>
      To test different elements of my program, I'm using something called a <b>test plan</b>.
      <br>
      I'll use the <b>test plan</b> to test different scenarios and then compare the expected outcomes to the actual outcomes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here's my <b>test plan</b>:
      <br>
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Scenario</th>
            <th>Data Used</th>
            <th>Expected Outcome</th>
            <th>Actual Outcome</th>
            <th>Evaluation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Handling multiple keywords sensibly</td>
            <td>A user's issue has more than 1 keyword present</td>
            <td>Typing 'my phone screen has water in it' as the issue</td>
            <td>To be told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>I was told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>This feature is "working" in my program. It's behaving as I expected but I may want to make solutions more accurate in the future by using multiple keywords.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Handling illegal input</td>
            <td>Inputting a blank issue</td>
            <td>Typing '' as the issue</td>
            <td>To be told it's an incorrect answer and to exit</td>
            <td>I was told it was an incorrect answer and the program exited</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Always giving a solution</td>
            <td>Having an unsolvable issue</td>
            <td>Typing 'milk' as both issues</td>
            <td>To be told there is no solution and to try again after the first issue and then to be told there is no solution and exit the program after the second issue</td>
            <td>I was told there is no solution and to try again after the first issue and then i was told there is no solution and the program exited after the second issue</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tailoring solutions based on keywords</td>
            <td>The user's phone is smashed</td>
            <td>Typing 'my phone is smashed' as the first issue</td>
            <td>To be told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>I was told to take it to the nearest repair shop</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      From my test plan I am satisfied with the reliable functionality of my program.
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Evaluation</i></b></h5>
        <hr>
        I feel as if I have achieved everything I set out to do from my analysis.
        <br><br>
        Now I'll use my success criteria to make sure that I have:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Succesfully loop over every individual word within the user's issue</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, I match keywords by looping over each individual word in the user's issue</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <ul>
            Yes, inputs that are blank are caught and the user is told that their input was incorrect
          </ul>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then just tell them to take it to the nearest repair shop</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, if we can't give a solution after they try their issue twice, they are told to take it to a repair shop</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Offer tailored solutions based on keywords within the user's issue</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, if a keyword match is found, a related solution is pulled from a dictionary</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Give the user a limited number of attempts until giving them a vague repair shop solution</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, if we can't give a solution after they try their issue twice, they are told to take it to a repair shop</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Great, I have completed my success criteria. My program also meets all requirements stated explicitly and implicitly within
          the task
