      <h4><i>Analysis</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        So, I need to develop a program where in which the user can first tell the program what device and model they are having
        issues with so that the program can load a different set of suitable question-answer pairs based on their device.
        <br>
        This program needs to incorporate a mechanism that transforms the user's input about their device into a concatendated filename.
        For example: if the user types 'iphone' for the device, and typed '5s' for the model, the program will load <code>iphone5s.txt</code>
        <br>
        I'll also need to write logic that will create a file with their device information and issue as well as assign them a case number for
        a support agent to access at a later date.
        <br>
        The first question I need to ask myself is what components of my programming knowledge am I going to have to use to develop this
        program. I wrote a short list in my notebook in real life, here's what i wrote:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            IF / ELSE / ELIF Statements
            <ul>
              I need these statements to work out whether or not the user's device is supported and also wether or not there is a solution available.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions
            <ul>
              I'm going to use functions to tidy up my code and make sure I'm not repeating things too much, a quick use I
              can think of is to write a function that displays a given message with a set prefix.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            FOR Loops
            <ul>
              I'm going to use FOR loops to loop over the lines in my .txt files looking for the solution to the user's given issue.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrays
            <ul>
              I'm going to use arrays to split up the issue-solution pairs within my .txt files.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            File accessing
            <ul>
              I'm going to use file accessing to load the device specific issue-solution pairs.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><b><i>Success Criteria</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll list what I want to achieve with my program so that I can compare my end result to it in my evaluation.
        <hr>
        This is my <b>success criteria</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Succesfully loop over the lines in the .txt files</li>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then store the info in a file for an agent</li>
          <li>Offer tailored solutions based on the user's device</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Planning</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        For my planning I've made a flowchart and also written some basic outline pseudocode to help display and demonstrate how my program will
        function and what basic logic it will follow.
        <br><br>
        Here's my <b>flowchart</b>:
        <br><br>
        <img src="../../../images/Documentation/Python/3/flowchart.png" class="img-rounded" height="50%" width="50%" />
        <br><br>
        And here's my <b>pseudocode</b>:
        <br>
        <pre>
          device = input('What device are you having issues with?') -> to lowercase
          model = sysinp('What model is it?') -> to lowercase
          filename = device + model + '.txt'
          if exists(filename) then
              issue = input('What is your issue?') -> to lowercase
              with open(filename,'r') as solutions do
                  for solution in solutions do
                      if issue in solution then
                          finalSolution = solution -> split(':')[1] -> rstrip()
                          print('Solution: '+finalSolution)
                          exit()
                      else then
                          continue
                  print('Sorry but we do not have a solution for you. We will log your issue with a case number for our agents to look at.')
                  case_number = t.time() -> int() -> str()
                  case = open('case-'+case_number+'.txt', 'w+')
                  case.write('Case number: '+case_number+'\n\n')
                  case.write('Device: '+device+'\n')
                  case.write('Model: '+model+'\n\n')
                  case.write('Issue: '+issue)
                  print('An agent will get back to you. Your case number is: '+case_number)
                  exit()
          else then
              print('Sorry, we do not support this device!')
              exit()

        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Development</i></h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Here's my <b>commented end code</b>:
        <br>
        https://gist.github.com/iJamesPHP/cd560e7f236f5e55202a8bbb49d3214c
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5><b><i>Discussion</i></b></h5>
      <p>
        In this section I'll describe the different aspects of my program, how they work and why I've chosen to do it that way.
        <hr />
        Rather than diving straight into the core logic, I start by defining functions that I'll find useful later in my program. I start by
        defining a function called <code>sysp()</code>, I use this function instead of the <code>print()</code> function so that I can always
        add the same prefix to all my outputs and structure them nicely.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>sysinp()</code>, this function is to add the same prefix as <code>sysp()</code> to input messages.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also wrote a function called <code>check_blank()</code> that goes inside the <code>sysinp()</code> function to catch illegal blank inputs and alert the user then exit
        the program.
        <br><br>
        <h5><b><i>Core Logic</i></b></h5>
        In this section I'll delve deeper into my core logic and how my code works proceduraly.
        <hr>
        Now I get into the core logic of the program, it works by first taking the user's input for their device name and the device model, the program then
        concatenates these two bits of data and appends '.txt' onto the end. If this file name doesnt exists, it's an unsupported device and the program exits.
        If this file name does exist, it's a supported device and the file is read. The user then types their issue. Then each line of the file is looped over
        and if it doesnt contain the user's issue then their device info and issue are stored in a .txt file with a case number for an agent, if it does contain
        the user's issue then the relevant solution in the file is printed and the program exits.
        <br>
        <br>
        I chose to use these logical steps in my program because it let's me cover the most important requirement, multi-device support via file accessing. By concatenating
        the user's inputted data to load seperate issue-solution pair files, I can tailor the solutions to the user's issues based on their device.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have files for these devices:
        <ul>
          <li><kbd>iphone5s</kbd></li>
          <li><kbd>iphone5c</kbd></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I could add more files to add support for more devices easily, this is good because it makes my program easily expandable.
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Testing</i></b></h5>
      <hr>
      To test different elements of my program, I'm using something called a <b>test plan</b>.
      <br>
      I'll use the <b>test plan</b> to test different scenarios and then compare the expected outcomes to the actual outcomes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here's my <b>test plan</b>:
      <br>
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Scenario</th>
            <th>Data Used</th>
            <th>Expected Outcome</th>
            <th>Actual Outcome</th>
            <th>Evaluation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Handling illegal input</td>
            <td>A user's input is blank</td>
            <td>Typing '' as the device name</td>
            <td>To be told it's an illegal input and the program will exit</td>
            <td>I was told it was an illegal input and the program exited</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Offer tailored solutions based on the user's device</td>
            <td>A user's iPhone 5S' touchid isn't working</td>
            <td>Typing 'iphone' as the device, '5s' as the model and 'touchid isnt working' as the issue</td>
            <td>To be told the solution is to try a hard reset and then the program will exit</td>
            <td>I was told the solution was to try a hard reset and then the program exited</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program, the lines are being looped over to search for the correct solution for the user's issue for that device</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Always giving a solution</td>
            <td>Having an unsolvable issue</td>
            <td>Typing 'iphone' as the device, '5c' as the model and 'i dont know how to describe it' as the issue</td>
            <td>To be told there is no solution and that their issue and device information have been logged in a file with a case number</td>
            <td>I was told there is no solution and my issue and device information had been logged to a .txt file with an attatched case number</td>
            <td>This feature is working in my program</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      From my test plan I am satisfied with the reliable functionality of my program.
      <br><br><br>
      <h4><b><i>Evaluation</i></b></h5>
        <hr>
        I feel as if I have achieved everything I set out to do from my analysis.
        <br><br>
        Now I'll use my success criteria to make sure that I have:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Succesfully loop over the lines in the .txt files</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, I loop over the lines in the device specific .txt files to find the solution to the user's issue</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Handle any illegal inputs</li>
          <ul>
            Yes, inputs that are blank are caught and the user is told that their input was incorrect and the program exits
          </ul>
          <li>Always give some sort of solution, if nothing is found then store the info in a file for an agent</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, if we can't give a solution, their device info and issue are logged in a .txt file with a case number</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Offer tailored solutions based on the user's device</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, by using multiple .txt files I can make the same question for different devices have tailored solutions</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        Great, I have completed my success criteria. My program also meets all requirements stated explicitly and implicitly within
          the task
